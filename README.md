# Simple Shell Project

## Overview

This project is a simple command line interpreter (shell) for my second C project at ALX_SE. It allows users to execute commands and interact with the UNIX operating system. The shell supports various functionalities that enhance the user experience and provide a basic understanding of how shells operate.

## Features

- **Command Execution**: Users can execute standard UNIX commands.
- **Argument Parsing**: The shell can parse command-line arguments, allowing users to pass parameters to commands.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling mechanisms are in place to manage invalid commands and other execution errors.
- **Environment Variables Management**: Users can access and manipulate environment variables seamlessly.
- **Built-in Commands**: Supports built-in commands such as:
  - exit: Exit the shell.
  - env: Display the current environment variables.
- **Logical Operators**: Supports logical operators for command execution:
  - &&: Execute the next command only if the previous command succeeded.
  - ||: Execute the next command only if the previous command failed.
- **Alias Management**: Users can create and manage command aliases for convenience.
